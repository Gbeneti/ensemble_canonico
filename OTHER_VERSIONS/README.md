# Ensemble Canonico

This folder contains older/outdated versions of the main file.

"ensemble_canonico_v2_not_updated.ipynb" is an alternative method to achieve the same as the main file. The main purpose was to make the code even more efficient. It is now out of date.

"ensemble_canonico_original_debug.ipynb" is the original version of the canonical ensemble made by João Guilherme Caramês. It is used as a debugger to some functions.

"ensemble_joao_pedro.py" is the João Aroucha's implementation regarding main problem. It was used as a base to implement the mean field approximation in the main files.
