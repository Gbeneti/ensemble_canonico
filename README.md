# Canonical Ensemble
Code that simulate a lattice-ensemble. code based on an older version from João Caramês.

The main version is an optimized/revised/repurposed. Its objective is to investigate how the energy between interactions and concentration of two liquids can influnce its mixture. The code is also capable to handle different temperatures in the Helholtz function.
