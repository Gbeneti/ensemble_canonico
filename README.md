# Canonical Ensemble
Code that simulates a lattice-ensemble model. The code was based on an older version from João Caramês located in "OTHER_VERSIONS".

The main file "ensemble_canonico_mistura" is an optimized/revised/repurposed version of "ensemmble_canonico". Its objective is to investigate how the energy between interactions and concentrations of two liquids can influnce mixture capabilites in the context of the canonical ensemble. The code is also capable to handle different temperatures in the Helholtz function.
